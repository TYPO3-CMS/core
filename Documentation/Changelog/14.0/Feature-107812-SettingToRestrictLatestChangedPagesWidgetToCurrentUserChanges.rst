Feature: #107812: Setting to restrict Latest changed Pages Widget to current user's changes
==========================================================================================

See :issue:`107812`

Description
===========

Building upon the configurable dashboard widgets functionality introduced in
:ref:`feature-107036-1738837673`, the existing Latest changed Pages Widget
can now be configured to display only pages that have been changed by the current TYPO3 users.

*Only show my changes*

Impact
======

* TYPO3 users can use the Latest changed Pages Widget to quickly resume their recent work.
* Existing setups are unaffected unless this option is explicitly enabled.
