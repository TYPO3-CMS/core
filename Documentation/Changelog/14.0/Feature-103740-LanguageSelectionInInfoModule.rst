Feature: #103740 - Language selection for backend module "Info - Pagetree Overview"
===================================================================================

See :issue:`103740`

Description
===========

The backend module :guilabel:`Web > Info > Pagetree Overview` is enriched by
a language selection.

This allows to switch the displayed Pagetree to the selected language, and adjust
all labels, edit and view links accordingly.

The language selection dropdown is right next to the other filter possibilities
(recursion depth, information type) and compliments the
:guilabel:`Web > Info > Localization Overview` with a page/record-focussed view.

Impact
======

The :guilabel:`Web > Info` backend module is more useful on sites with multiple
languages, to have a quick overview about information of the selected page and
its subpages.
